Mitch,
I’ve revised the information you provided as follows:
Purpose
Field Operations provides oversight for the day-to-day operations of all field offices in Florida and across the nation, including field account management, collections, audit, and campaigns processes.
Goal
Perform compliance activities to foster and ensure an equitable and level playing field for taxpayers.
I took out the word “businesses” from the goal because it seems redundant. Doesn’t taxpayers cover it?
Let us know if you agree with these edits. If not, please suggest additional changes.
Thanks,
Grace
