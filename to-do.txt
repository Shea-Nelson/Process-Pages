From Grace:
One thing I just noticed that needs to be corrected.  The purpose statement for Compliance Determination is the old version. Please replace with this version:
Compliance Determination identifies areas of non-compliance in tax reporting and payment, establishes corrective actions, 
and promotes voluntary compliance by all taxpayers. The four sub-processes are:  Audit, Campaigns, Criminal Investigation and Lead Development.
**Updated all purpose statements for 1st level pages
